# Lotta Chat ðŸ“±

Lotta Chat is a lightweight, privacy-focused chat app designed for Android as part of the [lotta.schule](https://lotta.schule) project. Our goal is to provide all **lotta.schule** users with easy, on-the-go access to their messages in a secure, user-friendly environment.

This app is the Android version, written in native Kotlin, and connects to the [Lotta API](https://github.com/lotta-schule/lotta) via GraphQL over WebSockets and HTTPS.

Lotta Chat also has an [iOS counterpart](https://github.com/lotta-schule/ios) and is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.einsa.lotta).

We plan to continue developing and improving these apps, working hard to honor our usersâ€™ whishes to the best of our ability within our limited resources.
